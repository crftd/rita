Security and privacy become more and more topical questions today.
There are companies that provide various services related to cyber security like VPN services or secure messaging apps,
and that's great, but there also some questions with no answer:

1.    What happens when the service altogether goes down? Regardless of the reason, third-party service provides a single point of failure.
If third-party service goes down, there will be no other option but just wait until and if it comes back up.

2.    What if (some of) these companies lie? The fact that the third-party haven't exposed your data yet
doesn't guarantee they won't do that in the future.

We believe that only setting up own infrastructure can give us enough confidence in our cyber security.
However, setting it up may become a not trivial task. **Rita** is a command line tool that simplifies that task.
